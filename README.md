## Statistical Analysis in R â€“ Evaluating Concrete Mixes for Compressive Strength

**Programming Language Used:** R  
**Application Used:** R Studio (for data analysis and visualization)

### Introduction
This analysis employs regression techniques to identify the optimal concrete mix for maximizing compressive strength. Key factors analyzed include cement, water, fine aggregate, blast furnace slag, fly ash, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and age.

### Objective
The objective is to explore the relationships between these factors and concrete compressive strength using non-parametric regression methods like Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and Random Forest. Hypothesis testing will also validate the optimal material mix for superior compressive strength.

### How to Use
- Download and install [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
- Open RStudio and navigate to `File > Open File` to open the `Task2.R` script.

### How to Run
- Run the entire script using the "Run" button or shortcuts:
  - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + Enter`
  - macOS: `Cmd + Shift + Enter`
- To run specific lines, highlight them and press `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows) or `Cmd + Enter` (macOS).
- View visualizations in the "Output" pane and results in the "Console" pane in RStudio.
